# BingoPlus Web App

Welcome to BingoPlus, a multiplayer game with two modes: Dumb Mode and Fun Mode. In Dumb Mode, the game is played like traditional bingo. In Fun Mode, players can bid on the current displaying number within 20 seconds.

Additionally, there are two magic tools that players can purchase with their account balance to use during the game. Tool One allows you to know the missing match numbers of the player who is most likely to win, while Tool Two allows you to have the table of the most matched player displayed in your view.

## Technologies Used

This app is developed on Django and utilizes OAuth Google Login. We also utilized AJAX, WebSocket, jQuery, and other web technologies to bring the game to life.

## Installation and Usage

To use the BingoPlus web app, simply navigate to the website and sign up with your Google account. Once logged in, you can choose between Dumb Mode and Fun Mode and start playing.

To purchase the magic tools, players must use their account balance to buy them within the game interface.
